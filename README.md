# ML-Cookbook
### Info 
ML-Cookbook is a repository that contains supervised learning algorithm templates. The algorithms are divided by regression and classification, as shown below in "List of Algorithms". 

### How To Use
Each algorithm is divided in different sections in Jupyter Notebook with appropriate instructions. None of the sections needs to be adjusted but the data input and input/target variables definition. Note that all algorithms use one dataset as an example. Therefore, in some algorithms, the quality of the input and target variables of being suitable or proper in the circumstances might be very low.
