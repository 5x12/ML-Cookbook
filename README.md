# ML Toolbox
### Info
ML Toolbox is a repository that contains supervised learning algorithm templates. The algorithms are divided by regression and classification categories as shown below in the section "List of Algorithms".

### How To Use
Each algorithm is divided in different sections in Jupyter Notebook with appropriate instructions. None of the sections needs to be adjusted but the data input indication and input/target variables.
